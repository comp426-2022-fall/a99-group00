List of proposed endpoints for the api.
Will probably need to convert this doc to an OpenAPI specification doc sometime later.

As per project guidelines, api root endpoint must be at "http://HOST/app/"

We will then split this into "/users" and "/trivia" depending on whether we are updating the user database or getting a trivia question.

TRIVIA endpoints
- GET: "/app/trivia/difficulty:"
    Returns one multiple choice question at specified difficulty with one correct answer and three incorrect answers


USERS endpoints
- POST "/app/users/:username"
    Creates user with specified name

- DELETE "/app/users/:username"
    Deletes user with specified name

- PUT "/app/users/:username"
    Update scores of user

- GET "/app/users/:username"
    Get score of user

- GET "/app/users/leaderboard"
    Get 5 top scoring users
